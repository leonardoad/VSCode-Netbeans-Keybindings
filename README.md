# VSCode-Netbeans-Keybindings
VS Code custom Keybindings  to emulate Netbeans keybindings

## Motivation
I created this, because I know that transitioning from one IDE to another is really a bummer!

Ever since I started using VS Code, I began to replicate Netbeans shortcuts on it.

This is a work in progress!
