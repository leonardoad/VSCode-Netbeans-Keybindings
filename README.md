# VSCode-Netbeans-Keybindings
VS Code custom Keybindings  to emulate Netbeans keybindings

## Motivation
I created this, because I know that transitioning from one IDE to another is really a bummer!

Ever since I started using VS Code, I began to replicate Netbeans shortcuts on it.

This is a work in progress! 


### Shortcuts

### Using

2. Type **">shortcuts (JSON)"** and press "Enter"
3. Copy content from [keybindings.json](https://github.com/leonardoad/VSCode-Netbeans-Keybindings/blob/master/keybindings.json)
4. Paste it into the opened file
5. Save it
6. Done!
